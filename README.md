## README

This is an example application to explore using react-rails.

It uses the [React Rails gem](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) to add react to the Rails asset pipeline and provide some convenience methods.

The approach in this sample app is to use Rails server-side routing while leveraging React on individual pages within the application.

To get up and running, clone this repo, bundle, and rake as normal.
